# üìä Task 5: SQL-Based Analysis of Product Sales

## üìå Task Description
In this task, we use the **Chinook Database** (available on Kaggle) to analyze product sales through SQL queries.  
The objective is to extract **business insights** from relational data by answering key questions such as:
- What are the **top-selling products**?
- What is the **revenue per region**?
- How is the **monthly performance** trending over time?

This analysis demonstrates how to combine **raw sales and product data** using SQL joins and aggregations.
