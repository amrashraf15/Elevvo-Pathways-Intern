## üìå Task Description  

This task involves performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the classic **Titanic dataset** ([Kaggle: Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)).  
The goal is to **explore, clean, and analyze** the dataset to uncover insights related to passenger survival.

## üìä Insights & Findings 

From the exploratory data analysis, the following insights were observed:  
- **Passenger Class (Pclass):**  
  Survival chances were much higher for **1st class passengers** compared to 2nd and 3rd class.
- **Gender:**  
  **Females had a significantly higher survival rate** than males, supporting the ‚Äúwomen and children first‚Äù policy.
- **Age Distribution:**  
  - Children (under ~10 years old) had higher survival rates.  
  - Older passengers had much lower chances of survival.  
- **Fare & Survival:**  
  Passengers who paid higher fares tended to survive more often. Survival rate increases with **fare range**.  

- **Embarkation Port (C, Q, S):**  
  - Passengers embarking from **Cherbourg (C)** had a higher survival rate.  
  - Those from **Southampton (S)** had the lowest.  

- **Family Size:**  
  - Very small families (2‚Äì4 members) had higher survival rates.  
  - Very large families (6+) or traveling alone had lower chances.  

- **Age Group & Class (Heatmap):**  
  - Young passengers in **1st and 2nd class** had the **highest survival probability**.  
  - Older passengers in **3rd class** had the **lowest chances** of survival.
